## Prerequisites

To run this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js and npm: Install them using nvm (Node Version Manager) for easy version management.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to clone and run the project locally:

Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
```

Replace <YOUR_GIT_URL> with the URL of your project's Git repository.

Navigate to the Project Directory
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

Replace <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME> with the name of your project directory.

## Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This installs all the necessary dependencies listed in package.json.

Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the Vite development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 (or the port specified in the terminal) to view the app.

## Editing the Code

You can edit the project using your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or text editor. Here are a few ways to make changes:
Using Your Preferred IDE

Open the project directory in your IDE (e.g., VS Code, WebStorm).

Make changes to the code in the src directory or other relevant files.

Save your changes and view them instantly in the browser if the development server is running.

Commit and push your changes to the repository:
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main

Editing Directly in GitHub

Navigate to the desired file in your GitHub repository.
Click the Edit button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
Make your changes and commit them directly with a descriptive message.

Using GitHub Codespaces

Go to the main page of your repository on GitHub.
Click the Code button (green button) near the top right.
Select the Codespaces tab and click New codespace.
Edit files within the Codespace environment.
Commit and push your changes when done.

Deploying the Project
To deploy the project, you can use a hosting platform like Vercel, Netlify, or any other service that supports static site deployment. Since this project is already deployed at https://support-me-three.vercel.app/, you can follow these steps to deploy updates or to a new platform:

Build the Project
npm run build

This generates a dist folder with the production-ready files.

Deploy to Vercel
If using Vercel:

Install the Vercel CLI: npm install -g vercel
Run vercel in the project directory and follow the prompts to deploy.
Alternatively, connect your GitHub repository to Vercel for automatic deployments on push.

Deploy to Other Platforms

For platforms like Netlify, upload the dist folder or connect your repository for automatic builds.
Follow the platform-specific instructions for deployment.

Connecting a Custom Domain
To connect a custom domain to your deployed project (e.g., on Vercel):

Navigate to your project's dashboard on the hosting platform (e.g., Vercel).
Go to Settings > Domains.
Follow the platform's instructions to add and verify your custom domain.
Update your domain's DNS settings with the provided records (e.g., A or CNAME records).

For detailed instructions, refer to your hosting platform's documentation (e.g., Vercel Custom Domains).
Troubleshooting

Node Version Issues: Ensure you're using a compatible Node.js version. Use nvm to switch versions if needed.
Dependency Errors: Run npm install again or delete node_modules and package-lock.json, then reinstall.
Build Errors: Check for syntax errors in your TypeScript or React code, and ensure all dependencies are up to date.
